    "This project aims to investigate the structure of poetry in terms of original structure of the poems with respect to existing corpus. We shall concentrate on Chakspeare HAMLET, with a comparison between its original English version and French translation. We are comparing the preservation of inherent stylistic properties through this translation.  \n",

    "\n",
    "> 1. Write a script that allows you to retrieve the text corresponding to HAMLET (character) sayings in the manuscript, while discarding stopwords and numbering and any non-related text. Separate the sayings of HAMLET character at each act for both original text and translation.  \n",

die to sleep To sleep perchance to dream Ay theres the rub For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil Must give us pause Theres the respect That makes calamity of so long life For who would bear the whips and scorns of time Th oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely The pangs of despised love the laws delay The insolence of office and the spurns That patient merit of th unworthy takes When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin Who would fardels bear To grunt and sweat under a weary life But that the dread of something after death The undiscovered country from whose bourn No traveler returns puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of Thus conscience does make

judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance oerweigh a whole theater of others O there be players that I have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it
